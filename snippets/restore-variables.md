- From the VS Code Terminal tab, open developer command prompt or PowerShell terminal in the project folder `TasksTracker.ContainerApps` (*root* of your project):

    === "Windows"
        ```shell
        cd ~\TasksTracker.ContainerApps
        ```
    === "Linux"
        ```shell
        cd ~/TasksTracker.ContainerApps
        ```

- Restore the previously-stored variables by executing the local script. The output informs you how many variables have been set.

    === "Windows"
        ```shell
        .\Variables.ps1
        ```
    === "Linux"
        ```shell
        . ./variables.sh
        ```
